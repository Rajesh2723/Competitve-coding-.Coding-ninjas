Problem statement
Sameer and Arpit want to overcome their fear of Maths and so they have been recently practising Maths problems a lot. Aman, their friend has been helping them out. But as it goes, Sameer and Arpit have got bored with problems involving factorials. Reason being, the factorials are too easy to calculate in problems as they only require the residue modulo some prime and that is easy to calculate in linear time. So to make things interesting for them, Aman - The Mathemagician, gives them an interesting task. He gives them a prime number P and an integer N close to P, and asks them to find N! modulo P. He asks T such queries.

Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 1000
1 < P <= 2*10^9
1 <= N <= 2*10^9
Abs(N-P) <= 1000
Sample Input:
3
2 5
5 11
21 71
Sample Output:
2

wilsons theorom:
(p-1)! mod p = -1 or (p-1)  given p is prime

fermats little theorom::
(1/a)%p = (a^(p-2))%p  where 'p' is prime and 'a' is integer (here 1/a = a inverse)
 
 
application : find (n!)%p

1. for n>p  (n!)%p = 0 since 'p' is one of factor

2. for n<p  (n!)%p can be written as

((1*2*3...n)(n+1*n+2*....p-1))%p = -1 (wilson theorom)
(n!)%p = -1 * (n+1)^-1 % p * (n+2)^-1%p * .... * (p-1)^-1 % p   note : (here (n+1)^-1 is (n+1) inverse)

now applying fermats little theorom (1/a)%p = (a^(p-2))%p  where 'p' is prime and 'a' is integer (here 1/a = a inverse)
